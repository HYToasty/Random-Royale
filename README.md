Random Royale is a physics-based first person shooter developed by Hydrogen Studios.
Each game, the map is randomly generated by our home made RanPNMap (Random Perlin Noise Map) algorithm;
Vehicles, Weapons, Buildings, Trees, Rocks, are placed randomly to add a chaotic side to the game.
The goal of this game is to procure fun to the player, with the most chaos and funny situations with the least bugs.
Our goal, at Hydrogen Studios, is to keep our games user-friendly, with our passion for game development.
